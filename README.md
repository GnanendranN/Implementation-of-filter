### Register Number:

### 1. Smoothing Filters

i) Using Averaging Filter
```Python




```
ii) Using Weighted Averaging Filter
```Python





```
iii) Using Gaussian Filter
```Python





```
iv)Using Median Filter
```Python





```

### 2. Sharpening Filters
i) Using Laplacian Linear Kernal
```Python

```

## OUTPUT:
### 1. Smoothing Filters


i) Using Averaging Filter


ii)Using Weighted Averaging Filter


iii)Using Gaussian Filter


iv) Using Median Filter


### 2. Sharpening Filters


i) Using Laplacian Kernal


ii) Using Laplacian Operator


## Result:
Thus the filters are designed for smoothing and sharpening the images in the spatial domain.
